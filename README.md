# 🌌 India Space Academy Astrophysics Summer School 2025 - Supernova Cosmology Project 🚀✨

Welcome to the repository containing the capstone project submitted for the **Astrophysics Summer School 2025** organized by **India Space Academy (ISA)** as part of INDIA SPACE WEEK. This project focuses on the analysis of supernova data to explore the expansion history of our Universe and the Hubble constant tension.

## 🌠 About the Project

This capstone project investigates the **Supernova Cosmology** by analyzing the **Pantheon+SH0ES dataset** to estimate the Hubble constant \(H_0\), study the expansion history of the Universe, and examine related cosmological parameters within the flat \(\Lambda\)CDM model framework.

## 🔭 Project Highlights

- **Hubble Constant Estimation:**  
  Fitted value \(H_0 = 72.97 \pm 0.17\) km/s/Mpc using the full Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, slightly higher than the Planck18 measurement (67.4 km/s/Mpc), highlighting the ongoing "Hubble tension" in cosmology.

- **Age of the Universe:**  
  Based on \(H_0\) and matter density parameter \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), the Universe's age is estimated to be ~12.36 billion years, with variations depending on \(\Omega_m\) value.

- **Redshift Subsamples Analysis:**  
  Comparison of low-redshift (\(z < 0.1\)) and high-redshift (\(z \geq 0.1\)) supernova samples shows minor tension in \(H_0\) values, implying potential systematic effects.

- **Residuals and Model Fit:**  
  Residual analysis confirms a good fit of the flat \(\Lambda\)CDM model to the data, with no significant systematic trends, supporting accelerated cosmic expansion and dark energy's presence.

- **Cosmological Model Assumptions:**  
  The model assumes flat geometry, a constant dark energy equation of state (w = -1), and Gaussian observational errors.
